        <p>
          I am an extrovert, a critical thinker, a great problems solver and I like making new friends who 
          give some great ideas.
          I like playing volleyball, football and cycling has been a best part of me ever since I was a young boy.
          Helping people in the communities is part of my activities, contributing in the communities where people 
          are in need of my services.
          I enjoy voluntary work for individuals and companies as it allows me to grow and meet new friends who have
          same interests as me.
